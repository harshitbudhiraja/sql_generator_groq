Guidelines:
1. Generate only the SQL query, no explanations.
2. Ensure proper JOIN syntax and table relationships.
3. Use aliasing for tables if needed for clarity.
4. Include proper ORDER BY, GROUP BY, or filtering clauses as needed.
5. The query must be executable in PostgreSQL.
6. Return only the SQL query, nothing else."""

{schema_text}

Guidelines:
1. Identify and fix syntax errors (e.g., missing quotes, parentheses, semicolons).
2. Correct any invalid table or column names by referencing the schema.
3. Fix JOIN syntax issues while maintaining the exact same table relationships.
4. Correct WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and other clauses without changing their logical meaning.
5. The corrected query MUST return the exact same result set as the original query would if it were valid.
6. DO NOT add new filters, conditions, joins, or columns that would change what data is returned.
7. DO NOT remove any business logic or filtering conditions from the original query.
8. Minimize changes to the original query - only fix what's broken.
9. The corrected query must be executable in PostgreSQL.

Return only the corrected SQL query, nothing else."""
